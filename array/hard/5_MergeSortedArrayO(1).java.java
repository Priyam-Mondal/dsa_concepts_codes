/*Similar to optimal approach 1, in this approach, we will use two pointers i.e. left and right, 
and swap the elements if the element at the left pointer is greater than the element at the right pointer. 

But the placing of the pointers will be based on the gap value calculated.

The formula to calculate the initial gap is the following:

Initial gap = ceil((size of arr1[] + size of arr2[]) / 2)

Assume the two arrays as a single continuous array and initially,
 we will place the left pointer at the first index and the right pointer at the (left+gap) index of that continuous array.

Now, we will compare the elements at the left and right pointers and move
 them by 1 place each time after comparison. While comparing we will
  swap the elements if the element at the left pointer > the element at the right pointer. 
  After some steps, the right pointer will reach the end and the iteration will be stopped. */

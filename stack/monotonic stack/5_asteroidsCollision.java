/*
 We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

 

Example 1:

Input: asteroids = [5,10,-5]
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.
Example 2:

Input: asteroids = [8,-8]
Output: []
Explanation: The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.
Example 3:

Input: asteroids = [10,2,-5]
Output: [10]
Explanation: The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.

/*
 1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of moving asteroids.
 2. Iterate through each asteroid in the input list:
    2.1. If the asteroid is moving to the right (positive value), push it onto the stack.
    2.2. If the asteroid is moving to the left (negative value), check for collisions:
        2.2.1. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is also moving left, push the current asteroid onto the stack.
        2.2.2. Otherwise, compare the absolute values of the top of the stack and the current asteroid to handle the collision.
 3. Return the stack as the final state of the asteroids.

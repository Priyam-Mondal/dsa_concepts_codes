/*

Given an unsorted integer array, find a pair with the given sum in it.

• Each input can have multiple solutions. The output should match with either one of them.

Input : nums[] = [8, 7, 2, 5, 3, 1], target = 10
Output: (8, 2) or (7, 3)

• The solution can return pair in any order. If no pair with the given sum exists, the solution should return null.

Input : nums[] = [5, 2, 6, 8, 1, 9], target = 12
Output: null
